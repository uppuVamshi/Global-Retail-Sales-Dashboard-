## ⭐ Features / Highlights

### 📌 Business Problem
Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data, making it difficult to identify trends, measure performance, and compare regions using raw spreadsheets alone.

Key business questions such as:
- Which regions generate the highest sales and profit?  
- How do sales and profit change year over year?  
- Which product categories drive maximum revenue?  
- Are high sales always linked with high profit?  

are hard to answer without interactive visualization.

The dashboard is designed to:
- Track overall sales, profit, and quantity trends  
- Compare performance across regions and countries  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products  
- Highlight yearly and monthly sales trends  
- Enable quick filtering using slicers for deep analysis
